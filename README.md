Microbiome analysis for phosphate-defense interaction

The code in this repository was used to analyze the microbial community assembled on roots of
plants growing in a wild soil (census) or on plates with a synthetic community (SynCom).

## Directories

The `census` directory contains code used to analyze the microbial community composition of
plants gorwing in wild Mason Farm soil.

The `syncom` directory contains code used to analyze the microbial community composition, and
the plant phenotypes, of plants growing on agar plates with a well-defined but complex
synthetic bacterial community, under different phosphate conditions.

## Data

The raw sequencing reads that underlie the data in these analysis are publicly available in
the European Nucleotide Archive's Short Read Archive under study accession: [PRJEB15671]
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB15671).
